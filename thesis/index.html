          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="text-block">
            Through the past 20 years Creative Computation has gained a lot of popularity in the Design community.
            Generative
            algorithms are used in advertisement, architecture, corporate identities, fashion and many other branches. I
            started my investigation into Computational Design from my own position as a Creative Coder and Digital
            Designer.<br>
            In my practice I mainly worked with rule-based generative systems to creative digital visuals for personal
            projects and clients. Over time though, I increasingly started to wonder about the potential of Creative
            Computation as a tool for a practice that would allow me to engage more critically with technology. This is
            the
            question I will try to answer through this thesis.
            <br><br>
            In 2002 Florian Cramer defined two types of software art. Software formalism and software culturalism. The
            former
            describes an art practice that is visually abstract and corresponds to the field of Generative Art, while
            the
            second suggests a predominantly critical/political position that focuses on the deconstruction of software.
            Mitchell Whitelaw has tried to bridge these two approaches in his paper System Stories and model worlds: A
            critical Approach to generative Art. He suggests that Generative Art can potentially show the cultural
            agency
            of
            software and propose alternatives to it. ‚As I have argued we can think of abstract software art, or
            generative
            art, as potentially exploring alternative modes of being and relation, telling stories but also literally
            toying
            with complex, dynamic systems, exploring them prospectively, and not (merely) as eye-candy machines, but as
            model
            worlds.‘() The idea that Generative Art, or Creative Computation–I will explain the difference between these
            terms
            in detail through the next chapter–can potentially be used as a tool to do critical or political commentary
            has
            also been entertained by Tayeoon Choi, a coder, artist and the founder of the School for Poetic Computation
            in
            New
            York. For Choi the computer is a non-neutral object. A massively large and abstract machine that is
            operating
            by
            the logic of capitalism. ‚When our lives are so profoundly affected by algorithms and programs, what are the
            acts
            of resistance or dissent that preserve our morality, our humanity?‘
            <br><br>
            Speculative Computation is an experimental definition for a creative practice that redefines and reimagines
            computational technology. It can find inspiration in the deconstruction of algorithms and the computational
            process, the recovery of traditional crafts, or the involvement of non-human organisms. As creatives working
            with
            code we are not restricted by the boundaries that define technology as a tool that only serves the purpose
            of
            problem solving. Speculative Computation could be a method to reconfigure the if-else statement of
            computation
            into a what-if. Creative Computation is the method that inspired me, Speculative Computation can be a way to
            go
            on. A method to speculate about a different present.

          <h2>Terminology</h2>
          <p class="text-block">
            There are dozens of definitions that more or less describe the same or similar processes:

            <span class="quote">
              Algorithmic Art, Algorithmic Composition, Cybernetic Art, 
              Computer(-Generated) Art, Creative Coding, Computational
              Design, Computational Creativity, Digital Art, Electronic Art, Generative Art, Generative
              Design,  Interactive Art, Process-based Art, Software Art, System Art, Technological Art, Telematics …
            </span>
            According to my former teacher Leonard Lass, who gave a class on Generative Art during my Bachelors, what we
            now subjectively
            considered as a creative practice involving some form of computation, cannot be clearly labeled, because the
            creative use of computational methods has a long history and a broad scope. (Lass, 2020)
            Most of the terms I introduced can be applied to work of various disciplines such as music, dance, fine-art,
            kinetic art, design and many more. They can furthermore either relate to the practice of coding on a
            computer, or the generative process itself. This makes it difficult to identify one coherent scope. I will
            introduce some terms that are often being used interchangeably but actually have their own specific
            meaning. For this thesis I choose to use the term: Creative Computation to refer to most of the work and
            processes involved since it seems to be the broadest definition available.


          </p>
          <h3>Generative Art & Generative Design</h3>
          <p>The term Generative Art refers to: any practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural
            language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with
            some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art. (Galanter, 2003)
            The first person to use the term generative in the context of art-making was Georg Nees. ‚The word
            generative was used here to identify art that was produced from a computer program and, hence, was at least
            in part produced automatically’ (Boden & Edmonds, 2009) His 1965 exhibition Generative Computergraphik was
            the first to feature computer-made images as art-objects.
            The idea of simple modular systems which operate on the combination and permutation of defined elements
            (Lass, 2020) however has been around for much longer and can probably be traced back to ornamental art from
            5000 BC. (Lass, 2020) A generative approach can also be found in many crafts that don’t fit into our current
            definition of Technology. Many of them were traditionally performed by women, such as spinning, needlework
            and knitting. (Wajman, 2006). </p>
          <h3>Creative Coding</h3>
          <p>Coding is a fragment of programming that involves the act of translating and communicating commands into
            machine language. (Yaduwanshi, 2021)
            The term Creative Coding is relatively new and has probably been first described in the late 90s and early
            20s when open-source coding languages like John Maeda‘s Design By Numbers made visual coding practices
            available for designers, who used coding as an extension to their existing creative skill-set. Creative
            Coding is “a discovery-based process consisting of exploration, iteration, and reflection, using code as a
            primary medium, towards a media artifact designed for an artistic context.” (Mitchell & Bown (2013, 143) as
            quoted in, Hansen, 2019, p.13)
          </p>
          <h3>Creative Computation</h3>
          <p>
            Although often used interchangeably Creative Computation and Creative Coding don‘t necessarily describe the
            same practice. Code provides a series of instructions for computation that requires logical systems and
            hardware to make these instructions computable. (Choi, 2017)
            Computation is a higher level concept than coding. (Choi, 2017) While Creative Coding is specifically
            focusing on the act of creatively writing code, often through existing coding languages and frameworks,
            Creative Computation involves all processes that are included in the execution of a command through a
            computer and can therefore be used to temper and experiment with them.

          <h2>Creative Computation and Design</h2>
          <h3>
            The emergence of Creative Computation in
            the Design field
          </h3>
          <p>
            From the very beginning Creative Computing was a niche practice, only exercised by a small number of people.
            When analogue computers were first developed in the 1950’s they were huge, highly expensive and completely
            inaccessible for the public to experiment with. The first step towards the emergence of Creative Coding
            practices was the introduction of integrated circuits, an essential component of modern information
            technology, and the future microcomputer. (Conrad et al., 2021, p.10) Microcomputers are what we today call
            a personal computer (PC). They are small-scale computers, designed to be used by one person at a time.
            (Shea, 2018) Following the desktop revolution of the 1970s, the use of the computer as a creative tool was
            slowly starting to interest more programmers and artists.(Hansen, 2019)
            <br><br>
            With the emergence of technologies like the Smartphone and the World Wide Web the early 2000s made new forms
            of social interaction and participation possible. (Conrad et al., 2021, p.10) It was during this time that
            creative coding practices entered mainstream media as more young creatives started to explore programming as
            part of their practice. (Hansen, 2019)<br>
            Programming had become trendy (Hansen, 2019, 21) and accessible, open
            source software was popularizing. In 2001 Casey Real and Ben Fry launched Processing, a software initially
            created to teach programming fundamentals within a visual context. (Fry & Reas, 2021)
            Processing was based on John Maedas experimental software DBN (Design by Numbers), that was created in the
            context of an experiment on teaching programming at the MIT Media Lab. DBN was launched in correspondence
            with a book that shared the same name. On his website Maeda describes his motivations: ‚The actual point of
            the book was to get more non-programmers to program as a means to hopefully realize how boring programming
            can be. And then to re-imagine, re-envision, and realize a superior form of programming for the
            non-mathematically inclined.‘ (Maeda, 2021)
            Tools and publications like these made Creative Coding more accessible to a broader public of designers and
            therefore majorly contributed to it’s emergence in the Design field.

            In the following years many coding languages, frameworks and books were released as the Creative Coding
            community gained traction. Generative Algorithms became an integral part in various disciplines like Graphic
            Design, Computer Games, Industrial Design, Architecture, Fashion and Visual Effects. (Lass, 2017) Through
            this time many studios, exhibitions and new media festivals were created that center around coding and the
            exploration of emerging technologies.

          </p>
          <h3>Should designers be able to code?</h3>
          <p>Following popular demand programming lessons became part of many design programs. (Hansen, 2019) Today
            various courses feature classes in Creative Coding, or Generative Art that usually teach visual programming
            languages like Processing, P5.js or Three.js. According to Hansen S. Møller’s publication: public class
            Graphic_Design implements Code { // Yes, but how? }, there are many arguments that justify why designers
            should be learning how to code. Coding expands the student’s options to translate, express and convert their
            ideas. It can also give more autonomy over the creative process, by providing open-source, self-made tools
            that are independent from the
            industry-standard, commercial software packages, like Adobe.
            (Hansen, 2019) While learning to code can be a useful skill for
            designers, the industrial push towards acquiring this skill can also
            create a lot of pressure for young creatives to learn to code even if they are not interested in the
            subject.
            Basic coding skills are increasingly becoming more important for job applicants that want to find work in
            the creative field. Sometimes they are considered a plus, that might increase the chance to be hired, other
            times coding is simply a requirement. Demian Conrad relates this to an increasing skepticism about
            „creative“ work that has been emerging since the beginning of the pandemic. The emphasis of the industry is
            now set on hard labor and effectiveness. (Lorusso et al., 2021, p.29)
            Coding is not a skill that is inherently creative or liberating. It can also become a tedious, repetitive,
            industrialized exercise. (Lorusso et al., 2021, p.31) This poses the question: Are designers pushed towards
            coding because it gives us the tools for a practice that is more independent, or is it just another step to
            assimilate us as a part of a ‚new collar‘ workforce? (Lorusso et al., 2021, p.31)
          </p>
          <h3>Poetic Computation and the SFPC
          </h3>
          <p>In 2017 Tayeoon Choi published the online-book Poetic Computation: Reader, which is based on lectures from
            the School for Poetic Computation in New York City. (Choi, 2021) The school which was founded in 2013 by
            Taeyoon Choi, Zach Lieberman, and Lauren Gardner (Choi, 2021) approaches programming from the perspective of
            creative writing. They motivate their students to work towards
            critical thinking, demystification of tools, and aesthetic inquiry. (School for poetic computation) Demian
            Conrad describes the SFCP in the introduction to his book Graphic Design in the Post-digital age, as the
            origin of many of the most innovative projects in creative coding today. (Conrad et al., 2021)
            <span class="quote">‚At SFPC, we like to think that poetic computation is when language meets mathematics,
              and logic meets electricity. Sometimes, poetic computation is literally writing poems with code.‘…’We
              clarified that while we are definitely interested in the intersection of language and computation, we want
              to explore a broader definition of the ‘poetic.’ We want to investigate the art of computation as well as
              the expressive qualities of code, including its aesthetic, visual, aural and material aspects.’ (Choi,
              2017) </span>
            For Choi the computer is a non-neutral object. A massively large and abstract machine that is operating by
            the logic of capitalism. ‚When our lives are so profoundly affected by algorithms and programs, what are the
            acts of resistance or dissent that preserve our morality, our humanity?‘ (Choi, 2017)

          <h2>Rediscovering the history of Creative Computation</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="quote">In the face of such touching silliness about technofixes (or techno-apocalypses),
              sometimes it is hard to remember that it remains important to embrace situated technical projects and
              their people. They are not the enemy; they can do many important things for staying with the trouble and
              for making generative oddkin.‘ (Haraway, 2016, p.3)</span>
            I wrote this chapter to learn about the history of Creative
            Computation. The following pages are not a chronological description of past events but instead consist of
            small stories that I found
            interesting and relevant.
            While starting to write I realized that the history of Creative
            Computation cannot be told without considering the history of the rise of modern technology. Many of the
            technologies that we use today are products of a capitalist acceleration process and military
            innovation. Airplanes, missiles, tanks, drones, satellites, GPS, and
            digital computers would not exist otherwise. (Roland, 2017)
            It is this process of production and reproduction of technology that makes it easy to lose the connection to
            past developments and stories that are mandatory to shape the present moment consciously.
            Right now, when it comes to technology, the future seems to happen before the present. Recent examples from
            the IT world show how this future-oriented thinking is influencing people‘s lives today. While Amazon has
            been strongly criticized for it‘s terrible working conditions in warehouses throughout the pandemic, Jeff
            Bezos–who by the way massively profited from the Covid outbreak–has put insane amounts of money into space
            exploration to launch himself up into orbit.
            Mark Zuckerberg has faced multiple scandals in the past years. Among them the harvesting of data from
            millions of facebook users for the 2016 U.S. election, and the failure to interfere when the social network
            was used as a platform to incite genocide against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Myanmar. (Meisenzahl &
            Canales, 2021)Yet the company doesn‘t seem to make significant changes to protect their users or change
            their business model. Instead Facebook, or how it is now called Meta, is currently puring resources and
            advertising into a futuristic VR-meeting space–the metaverse.

              The process of reworking past narratives has been identified as a crucial method for changing the present
              by
              many feminist scholars. In her book Critical Fabulations Daniele K. Rosner proposes a redefinition of the
              design practice as both activist and investigative, personal and culturally situated, responsive and
              responsible. (Rosner, 2020, p.39)
              <span class="quote">
                ‚Derived from the practice of telling fables or stories, the term fabulation orients design toward
                narrative potentials. Feminist philosophers Saidiya Harman, Vinciane Despret, and Donna Haraway have
                discussed fabulations as imaginative resources that make way for living differently in the present.
                Fabulations blend the real and implausible in the manner of science fiction
                to open pathways for examining the tensions within. ‘

          <h3>Innovation</h3>
          <p>

            200 years ago Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program in history. It was a program that should run on
            Charles Babbage Analytical Engine, a machine made of metal gears that would be able to execute if/then
            commands and store information in a memory. Babbage motivation behind this engine, that couldn’t be realized
            during his lifetime, was the automation of mathematical calculations, previously completed by people.
            The story of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage takes place in a time when mechanical computers were not
            executable and researching them certainly was not profitable. (O‘SHEA, 2021) This, of course, was about to
            change.
            <span class="quote">‚The society which enters the twenty-first century is no less ‚mod­ern‘ than the society
              which entered the twentieth; the most one can say is that it is modern in a different way. What makes it
              as modern as it was a century or so ago is what sets modernity apart from all other historical forms of
              human cohabitation: the compulsive and obsessive, continuous, unstoppable, forever incomplete
              moderni­zation; the overwhelming and ineradicable, unquenchable thirst for creative destruction (or of
              destructive creativity, as the case might be: of ‚clearing the site‘ in the name of a ‚new and improved‘
              design; of ‚dismantling‘, ‚cutting out‘, ‚phasing out‘, ‚merging‘ or ‚downsizing‘, all for the sake of a
              greater capacity for doing more of the same in the future - enhancing productivity or competitive­ ness.‘
              (Bauman, 2000, p.28)
            </span>

            The concept for an advanced computing device was eventually realized in the 1927 in the form of Bush‘s
            Differential Analyzer. Soon after, the meaning of the term ‚technology‘ would change forever. According to
            Judy Wajman–a scholar and university professor who is researching the gendered nature of
            technology–‚technology‘ would from thereone be equated with applied science.
            This change was due to the rising of male engineers as an elite that possessed exclusive rights over
            technical expertise. (Wajman, 2006) Technological development had boomed through the first World War and it
            was the pressure of the Second that made digital computers possible. 22 years would pass until the first,
            military produced, computer graphic would be called ‚a fine art object‘. An event that can be considered the
            beginning of Computational Art.
            <span class="quote">
              There is little doubt that in computer art, the true avant-garde is the military. ‘ Georg Metzger, 1969
              (Rosen & Metzger, 2011)</span>
            Prior to World War II, the Machine Aesthetic, an aesthetic that emphasized the beauty of the machine – a
            beauty that is rooted in appearance and function, was widely used in various pieces of art and design. It
            can be assumed that it expressed the widespread enthusiasm for technological advances.
            Maybe the most extreme example of this enthusiasm were the Futurists, a group of Italian avant garde artists
            led by Filippo Marinetti, who, according to Tayeoon Choi, are nowadays often considered as the pioneers of
            New Media Art. (Choi, 2017) Many Futurists were supporters of Fascism and believed in misogynistic
            narratives that devalued women. They saw a great potential in the artistic exploration of technology and
            used machines as motives in posters, film and audio. ‚Right from the early days of the futurist movement, in
            1909, its affiliates sought to exalt technology as a positive force of modernity, worthy of artistic
            representation.‘(Aguilar et al.) Through art they explored notions of  progress, speed, movement, power, but
            also nationalism and robotic automation.(Aguilar et al.) They thought of war as a tool that could unleash
            the full potential of technology, and therefore considered it as the ultimate form of beauty and
            inspiration:
            <span class="quote">‚War is beautiful because it establishes man’s dominion over the subjugated machinery by
              means of gas masks, terrifying megaphones, flame throwers, and small tanks. War is beautiful because it
              initiates the dreamt-of metallization of the human body. War is beautiful because it enriches a flowering
              meadow with the fiery orchids of machine guns. War is beautiful because it combines the gunfire, the
              cannonades, the cease-fire, the scents, and the stench of putrefaction into a symphony. War is beautiful
              because it creates new architecture, like that of the big tanks, the geometrical formation flights, the
              smoke spirals from burning villages, and many others ... Poets and artists of Futurism! ... remember these
              principles of an aesthetics of war so that your struggle for a new literature and a new graphic art ...
              may be illumined by them!’ - excerpt of the Futurist Manifesto 1909‘ (Benjamin & Zohn, 2018 as quoted in
              Choi 2017)
              The Futurists thought that innovative technology would continue to solve all of humanities problems no
              matter the cost.</span>

          <p>Alfred Edward Chalon, Lady Lovelace, 1840<br><br>
            Lovelace understood the enormous potential of the machine that Babbage proposed. She once wrote: ‚That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal; as time will show.‘ (Thompson, 2019)
            Lovelace died with 36. One might wonder what her contribution to computation could have been, had she been living in a society where women’s involvement in science and technology was encouraged. (Thompson, 2019)(O‘SHEA, 2021)
